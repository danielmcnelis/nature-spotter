        Here at Nature Spotter we aim to connect people through nature. We
        encourage experts and novices alike to upload photos of any interesting
        plants, animals and fungi they happen upon. We then use the photo's
        meta-data to create a fun and interactive tool to discover the identity,
        distribution and beauty of these creatures. Your backyard has more to
        offer than it seems!

        We launched in May 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. When the economy
        slowed down, nature came out to play--social media swelled with an
        outpouring of local critter sightings. We saw this as an opportunity to
        provide a more direct and entertaining means to share these natural
        wonders. Since then we've never looked back, except to identify bird
        calls.
